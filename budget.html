    <h1>The City's Budget Does Not Prioritize Electric Vehicles</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">As part of its Capital Budget for FY 2020-2024, the city of Boston committed $300,000 to expanding the number of electric vehicle charging stations in municipal lots. While this may sound like a lot, the proposal will create just 18 new electric vehicle charging stations (corresponding with 36 electric vehicle charging ports) over the next five years.</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">The investment in electric vehicles includes an initial $100,000 investment in FY 2020 and an additional $200,000 investment over the FY 2021-2024 period. The investment is appropriated through the city's Transportation Department, which is currently slated to receive over $123 million in capital investment over the next five years. Although that sum is sixth-most among municipal agencies, the Transportation Department receives less investment than the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Boston Public Library. The Department of Environment is receiving even less investment--just over $61 million over the next five years. Every public dollar spent is a choice and the city's current Capital Plan does not prioritize fleet electrification or other environmental goals.</p>

    <h1>The Transportation Department Does Not Prioritize Electric Vehicles</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">The city of Boston plans to invest $123 million in the Transportation Department over the next five years. Of that planned investment, 79 percent is car-centric. And yet, investments in electric vehicles compose just 0.2 percent of overall transportation investments over the next five years.</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Although many of the city's car-centric transportation investments are worthwhile measures to improve the safety of the city's roadways, there is still a striking lack of investment in electric vehicles. Of the Transportation Department's 30 capital investment projects, just one is related to electric vehicles.</p>

    <h1>The City Must Invest More In Electric Vehicles</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">To keep up with growth in consumer demand, the city must install at least 1,800 additional electric vehicle chargers by the end of the decade. This will cost approximately $21.6 million.</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Currently, the city is investing in Level 2 electric vehicle chargers, which are more powerful and more durable than the chargers used by the typical consumer at home. In addition to installation costs, which can range from $80,000 to $100,000 per site, the equipment for each EV charging site can cost up to $6,000. As a result, building 1,800 additional charging stations will cost the city approximately $21.6 million. While this might sound like a lot, it is less than 0.01% of the city's 10-year budget.</p>

    <h1>The City Needs to Install More Chargers</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">Over the past six years, electric vehicle ownership have grown at an annual average growth rate of 37 percent per year. Assuming that rate of growth continues, the city will need to purchase 1,800 additional charging stations in order to keep up with consumer demand.</h4>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">As a nascent industry, electric vehicles have grown rapidly both in the United States and around the world. Still, it is reasonable to assume that strong growth will continue in the near-term. In 2018, the latest year for which data are available, electric vehicle ownership grew by 47 percent in the United States. This number is likely higher in a dense metropolitan area such as Boston, which is comparatively conducive to electric vehicle usage. To maintain today's ratio of electric vehicles to charging stations, the city will need to install 1,800 charging stations by 2030.</p>
