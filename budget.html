    <h1>The City Needs to Install More Chargers</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">Over the past six years, electric vehicle ownership have grown at an annual average growth rate of 37 percent per year. Assuming that rate of growth continues, the city will need to purchase 1,800 additional charging stations in order to keep up with consumer demand.</h4>

    <p class="w3-text-grey">As a nascent industry, electric vehicles have grown rapidly both in the United States and around the world. Still, it is reasonable to assume that strong growth will continue in the near-term. In 2018, the latest year for which data are available, electric vehicle ownership grew by 47 percent in the United States. This number is likely higher in a dense metropolitan area such as Boston, which is comparatively conducive to electric vehicle usage. To maintain today's ratio of electric vehicles to charging stations, the city will need to install 1,800 charging stations by 2030.</p>

    <h1>EV Chargers Come at a Price</h1>
    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">To keep up with growth in consumer demand, the city must install at least 1,800 additional electric vehicle chargers by the end of the decade. This will cost approximately $21.6 million.</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">Currently, the city is investing in Level 2 electric vehicle chargers, which are more powerful and more durable than the chargers used by the typical consumer at home. In addition to installation costs, which can range from $80,000 to $100,000 per site, the equipment for each EV charging site can cost up to $6,000. As a result, building 1,800 additional charging stations will cost the city approximately $21.6 million. While this might sound like a lot, it is less than 0,01% of the city's 10-year budget.</p>
