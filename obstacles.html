    <h1>Obstacles to Electric Vehicle Ownership<h1>
     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">In Boston, there are approximately eight electric vehicle charging stations for every electric vehicle. This compares favorably to the national statewide median of 11 electric vehicles per charging station. But while Boston's vehicle-to-charger ratio is currently above average, it needs to continue to invest in charging stations if it hopes to keep up with strong projected growth of consumer demand.</h4>
     <p class="w3-text-grey"> There are an estimated 3,055 electric vehicles in Boston, compared with an estimated 380 publicly available charging stations. This presents a challenge for current and potential electric vehicle owners. Although this compares favorably with the national average, it is important to maintain a similar ratio of vehicles to charging station going forward. This will require considerably more investment than is currently being devoted in the city of Boston's Capital Plan.</p> 
     <p class="w3-text-grey"> Maintaining a low ratio of electric vehicles to electric vehicle charging stations is essential to ensuring that electric vehicles are a viable method of transporation. A lack of publicly accessible charging stations increases the likelihood that a driver running low on charge will become stranded away from their home. It also increases the inconvenience of owning an electric vehicle. In fact, a survey conducted as part of the city of Boston's 2019 Climate Action Plan found that 45 percent of Boston residents would purchase an electric vehicle if they knew they had access to a charging port.</p>

     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">The map below shows the current locations of electric vehicle charging stations in Boston. </h4> 
     <p class="w3-text-grey">The overall number of charging stations in the city also masks stark geographic differences in the layout of those stations. Some neighborhoods, such as Downtown Boston and the Seaport District, have enough charging stations to accommodate electric vehicle users. But others, including large swaths of South Boston including Jamaica Plain and Roxbury, contain almost no electric vehicle charging stations. For individuals living in those neighborhoods, owning an electric vehicle is considerably more burdensome.</p>

     <h1>Planned Expansion of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations<h1>
     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">The map below shows the future planned expansion of electric vehicle charging stations in Boston.</h4>
     <p class="w3-text-grey">Over the next five years, the city of Boston plans to spend $300,000 to expand the number of electric vehicle charging stations in municipal lots. Each of the six lots pictured below is slated to receive between four and six additional charging ports by the end of FY 2024. Although this expansion helps offset some of the current geographic inequities in charger placement, more must be done to ensure electric vehicle ownership is a realistic option for all Bostonians.</p>
