    <h1>Obstacles to Electric Vehicle Ownership<h1>
     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">In Boston, the number of electric vehicle charging stations has not kept up with growth in the number of electric vehicles.</h4>
     <p class="w3-text-grey"> Although there are an estimated 1,200 electric vehicles in Boston, there are only about 150 publicly available charging stations. This presents a challenge for current and potential electric vehicle owners. A lack of accessible charging stations increases the likelihood that a driver running low on charge will become stranded away from their home. It also increases the inconvenience of owning an electric vehicle. In fact, a survey conducted as part of the city of Boston's 2019 Climate Action Plan found that 45 percent of Boston residents would purchase an electric vehicle if they knew they had access to a charging port.</p>

    <h1>Current Electric Vehicle Charging Stations<h1>
     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">The map below shows the current locations of electric vehicle charging stations in Boston. </h4> 
     <p class="w3-text-grey">The overall number of charging stations in the city also masks stark geographic differences in the layout of those stations. Some neighborhoods, such as Downtown Boston and the Seaport District, have enough charging stations to accommodate electric vehicle users. But others, including large swaths of South Boston including Jamaica Plain and Roxbury, contain almost no electric vehicle charging stations. For individuals living in those neighborhoods, owning an electric vehicle is considerably more burdensome.</p>

     <h1>Planned Expansion of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations<h1>
     <h4 class="w3-padding-16">The map below shows the future planned expansion of electric vehicle charging stations in Boston.</h4>
     <p class="w3-text-grey">Over the next five years, the city of Boston plans to spend $300,000 to expand the number of electric vehicle charging stations in municipal lots. Each of the six lots pictured below is slated to receive between four and six additional charging ports by the end of FY 2024. Although this expansion helps offset some of the current geographic inequities in charger placement, more must be done to ensure electric vehicle ownership is a realistic option for all Bostonians.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">This map integrated the current chargind stations and the planned expansions. As the red circle shows, there are still huge areas witout chaeging stations. Even with the planned expansion of electric vehicle charging stations in municipal lots, more charging stations are needed to ensure EV ownership is a realistic option for all Bostonians.  </p>
